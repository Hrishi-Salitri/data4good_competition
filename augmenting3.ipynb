The seminar provided a safe space for me to connect with others who were going through similar struggles and allowed me to feel supported and understood.\\n\\nOne aspect of the seminar that stood out to me was the emphasis on the importance of self-care and taking time to focus on my own well-being, while also acknowledging the challenges of managing family responsibilities in the midst of grief. The workshops and activities offered valuable tools and resources that have helped me to navigate this difficult journey and find a renewed sense of purpose.\\n\\nHowever, I would suggest that TAPS consider incorporating more age-specific content and workshops for younger participants, such as myself.

While the resources and tools discussed at the seminar proved useful, I felt that the seminar fell short in addressing the internal conflicts that our family experienced. In order to better assist families coping with loss, I believe it would be beneficial to incorporate additional workshops or support groups specifically targeted at enhancing communication and understanding among family members.

While some of us were more open to seeking support from others, some family members did not feel comfortable expressing their emotions. This led to a divide in our group and highlighted the need for a more tailored approach to support each person individually.\\n\\nOne area that could be improved is providing additional resources for family members who may not be open to seeking help or support from others.

While I found the seminars and resources provided by the experts to be incredibly helpful and supportive, I feel there is still tension within my family unit. It\\'s challenging to navigate, as each of us is dealing with the loss in our own way and at different speeds. I would like to see more family-centered support and understanding, as it seems like some of my family members may be struggling with their grief independently. However, the TAPS Seminar provided me with the tools and community to better manage my own grief, and I am grateful for that.\"\\n\\nExample 35:\\nQ1: 5\\nQ2: 5.0\\nQ3: 1\\nQ4: 0\\nQ5: 0\\nQ6: 0\\nQ7: 2\\nQ8: 3\\nQ9: 1\\nQ10: 1\\nQ11: 2\\nQ12: 0\\nQ13: 1\\nQ14: 3\\nQ15: 3\\nQ16: 3\\nQ17: 0\\nQ18: 2\\nQ19: 3\\nQ20: 0\\nFree Text Response 1: \"Over the weekend at the TAPS seminar, my favorite moment was during the group discussion session, where we were encouraged to share our grief experiences openly and honestly with each other. For the first time, I felt a sense of relief in expressing my emotions and concerns about the tension within my family unit and the lack of support I\\'ve been experiencing.\\n\\nDuring a private conversation with one of the grief experts, I had a breakthrough moment that allowed me to gain some clarity on my situation. I was told that it\\'s normal for family members to be at different stages in their grief journey, and that I shouldn\\'t compare my process to others. This insight has helped me to let go of the unrealistic expectations I had for my family\\'s grief experience, and to focus on finding ways to support and nurture my own emotional healing.\\n\\nThank you, TAPS, for providing a safe space and opportunities to grow, learn, and connect with others who share a similar journey. Your support and resources have been invaluable to me.\"\\nFree Text Response 2: \"As a participant of the TAPS Seminar, I found the experience to be incredibly valuable in helping me navigate my grief journey and understand the unique experiences my family members may be going through. The seminar provided a safe space for me to connect with other survivors who could relate to my story, and it was comforting to know we are not alone in our struggles.\\n\\nHowever, I noticed tension between my family members during the seminar, as we each cope with our loss in our own way. While some of us were more open to seeking support from others, some family members did not feel comfortable expressing their emotions. This led to a divide in our group and highlighted the need for a more tailored approach to support each person individually.\\n\\nOne area that could be improved is providing additional resources for family members who may not be open to seeking help or support from others. While the TAPS Seminar had many experts on grief and trauma, I think it would be beneficial to include workshops or sessions specifically for families with varied levels of engagement in the grieving process. This could help in bridging the gap within the family unit and ensure that everyone receives the support they need.\\n\\nOverall, I am grateful for the support and resources provided by TAPS during the seminar. I believe that with further consideration of individual family dynamics, TAPS can continue to help families heal and grow stronger through their grief journey.\"\\n\\nExample 26:\\nQ1: 4\\nQ2: 0.0\\nQ3: 0\\nQ4: 1\\nQ5: 1\\nQ6: 1\\nQ7: 2\\nQ8: 0\\nQ9: 3\\nQ10: 0\\nQ11: 3\\nQ12: 1\\nQ13: 0\\nQ14: 1\\nQ15: 0\\nQ16: 0\\nQ17: 1\\nQ18: 0\\nQ19: 3\\nQ20: 3\\nFree Text Response 2: Attending the TAPS Seminar came with a range of emotions for me, as I was not only seeking support for myself but for my entire family. Though the seminar provided a secure environment for processing grief, I noticed that tension prevailed among my family members, each of whom was dealing with their individual grief journey at varying speeds. While the resources and tools discussed at the seminar proved useful, I felt that the seminar fell short in addressing the internal conflicts that our family experienced. In order to better assist families coping with loss, I believe it would be beneficial to incorporate additional workshops or support groups specifically targeted at enhancing communication and understanding among family members. By doing so, it would provide a more comprehensive support system for families navigating these trying times. Ultimately, I am grateful for the opportunity to connect with other bereaved individuals and learn valuable lessons from the seminar; however, I truly believe that addressing family dynamics more effectively would have significantly enhanced the seminar\\'s overall impact for our family unit.\\n\\nExample 19:\\nQ1: 4\\nQ2: nan\\nQ3: 1\\nQ4: 1\\nQ5: 1\\nQ6: 0\\nQ7: 0\\nQ8: 3\\nQ9: 3\\nQ10: 0\\nQ11: 0\\nQ12: 0\\nQ13: 0\\nQ14: 3\\nQ15: 0\\nQ16: 1\\nQ17: 1\\nQ18: 0\\nQ19: 1\\nQ20: 2\\n            \\n            Current Question: Please share any additional feedback you have regarding your TAPS Seminar experience.\\n            Please respond with a full-text answer in English reflecting your experience at this stage.\\n            Response:\\n            '}]\n",

So we chose to use the resoruces from TAPS to make a personnal plan to help each meber in the family. We felt that going deeper into our connectio was good for us, helping us to be better comminucators and be a stronger family.\\n\\nAt the end, TAPS helped us lot in guiding us through our tough time, and taught us some valuble lessons in respeting each othr and being supoortive.

I was told that it\\'s normal for family members to be at different stages in their grief journey, and that I shouldn\\'t compare my process to others. This insight has helped me to let go of the unrealistic expectations I had for my family\\'s grief experience, and to focus on finding ways to support and nurture my own emotional healing.\\n\\nThank you, TAPS, for providing a safe space and opportunities to grow, learn, and connect with others who share a similar journey.

While some of us were more open to seeking support from others, some family members did not feel comfortable expressing their emotions.

This insight has helped me to let go of the unrealistic expectations I had for my family\\'s grief experience, and to focus on finding ways to support and nurture my own emotional healing.\\n\\nThank you, TAPS, for providing a safe space and opportunities to grow, learn, and connect with others who share a similar journey. Your support and resources have been invaluable to me.\"\\nFree Text Response 2: \"As a participant of the TAPS Seminar, I found the experience to be incredibly valuable in helping me navigate my grief journey and understand the unique experiences my family members may be going through. The seminar provided a safe space for me to connect with other survivors who could relate to my story, and it was comforting to know we are not alone in our struggles.\\n\\nHowever, I noticed tension between my family members during the seminar, as we each cope with our loss in our own way. While some of us were more open to seeking support from others, some family members did not feel comfortable expressing their emotions. This led to a divide in our group and highlighted the need for a more tailored approach to support each person individually.\\n\\nOne area that could be improved is providing additional resources for family members who may not be open to seeking help or support from others. While the TAPS Seminar had many experts on grief and trauma, I think it would be beneficial to include workshops or sessions specifically for families with varied levels of engagement in the grieving process. This could help in bridging the gap within the family unit and ensure that everyone receives the support they need.\\n\\nOverall, I am grateful for the support and resources provided by TAPS during the seminar. I believe that with further consideration of individual family dynamics, TAPS can continue to help families heal and grow stronger through their grief journey.\"\\n\\nExample 22:\\nQ1: 4\\nQ2: 0.0\\nQ3: 1\\nQ4: 0\\nQ5: 0\\nQ6: 0\\nQ7: 2\\nQ8: 2\\nQ9: 0\\nQ10: 3\\nQ11: 1\\nQ12: 2\\nQ13: 3\\nQ14: 2\\nQ15: 1\\nQ16: 2\\nQ17: 0\\nQ18: 2\\nQ19: 0\\nQ20: 3\\nFree Text Response 2: \"As a participant at the TAPS seminar, I appreciated the opportunity to be surrounded by individuals who understand the unique struggles of losing a loved one in the military.

They seem to not understand the depth of my grief, and it is challenging to communicate that to them.\\n\\nThe TAPS seminar provided valuable resources for me to better support myself and my grieving process. The peer-based support and expert-led workshops offered a safe space for processing emotions and learning tools to manage my grief.

Though the seminar provided a secure environment for processing grief, I noticed that tension prevailed among my family members, each of whom was dealing with their individual grief journey at varying speeds. While the resources and tools discussed at the seminar proved useful, I felt that the seminar fell short in addressing the internal conflicts that our family experienced. In order to better assist families coping with loss, I believe it would be beneficial to incorporate additional workshops or support groups specifically targeted at enhancing communication and understanding among family members. By doing so, it would provide a more comprehensive support system for families navigating these trying times. Ultimately, I am grateful for the opportunity to connect with other bereaved individuals and learn valuable lessons from the seminar; however, I truly believe that addressing family dynamics more effectively would have significantly enhanced the seminar\\'s overall impact for our family unit.\\n\\nExample 15:\\nQ1: 4\\nQ2: nan\\nQ3: 2\\nQ4: 2\\nQ5: 0\\nQ6: 1\\nQ7: 3\\nQ8: 0\\nQ9: 1\\nQ10: 2\\nQ11: 3\\nQ12: 3\\nQ13: 2\\nQ14: 3\\nQ15: 3\\nQ16: 3\\nQ17: 3\\nQ18: 1\\nQ19: 0\\nQ20: 1\\nFree Text Response 1: \"I had a breakthrough moment at the TAPS seminar that truly stands out for me.

Though the seminar provided a secure environment for processing grief, I noticed that tension prevailed among my family members, each of whom was dealing with their individual grief journey at varying speeds. While the resources and tools discussed at the seminar proved useful, I felt that the seminar fell short in addressing the internal conflicts that our family experienced. In order to better assist families coping with loss, I believe it would be beneficial to incorporate additional workshops or support groups specifically targeted at enhancing communication and understanding among family members. By doing so, it would provide a more comprehensive support system for families navigating these trying times. Ultimately, I am grateful for the opportunity to connect with other bereaved individuals and learn valuable lessons from the seminar; however, I truly believe that addressing family dynamics more effectively would have significantly enhanced the seminar\\'s overall impact for our family unit.\\n\\nExample 15:\\nQ1: 4\\nQ2: nan\\nQ3: 2\\nQ4: 2\\nQ5: 0\\nQ6: 1\\nQ7: 3\\nQ8: 0\\nQ9: 1\\nQ10: 2\\nQ11: 3\\nQ12: 3\\nQ13: 2\\nQ14: 3\\nQ15: 3\\nQ16: 3\\nQ17: 3\\nQ18: 1\\nQ19: 0\\nQ20: 1\\nFree Text Response 1: \"I had a breakthrough moment at the TAPS seminar that truly stands out for me.

Your support and resources have been invaluable to me.\"\\nFree Text Response 2: \"As a participant of the TAPS Seminar, I found the experience to be incredibly valuable in helping me navigate my grief journey and understand the unique experiences my family members may be going through. The seminar provided a safe space for me to connect with other survivors who could relate to my story, and it was comforting to know we are not alone in our struggles.\\n\\nHowever, I noticed tension between my family members during the seminar, as we each cope with our loss in our own way. While some of us were more open to seeking support from others, some family members did not feel comfortable expressing their emotions. This led to a divide in our group and highlighted the need for a more tailored approach to support each person individually.\\n\\nOne area that could be improved is providing additional resources for family members who may not be open to seeking help or support from others. While the TAPS Seminar had many experts on grief and trauma, I think it would be beneficial to include workshops or sessions specifically for families with varied levels of engagement in the grieving process. This could help in bridging the gap within the family unit and ensure that everyone receives the support they need.\\n\\nOverall, I am grateful for the support and resources provided by TAPS during the seminar. I believe that with further consideration of individual family dynamics, TAPS can continue to help families heal and grow stronger through their grief journey.\"\\n\\nExample 48:\\nQ1: 4\\nQ2: 2.0\\nQ3: 2\\nQ4: 1\\nQ5: 2\\nQ6: 1\\nQ7: 1\\nQ8: 1\\nQ9: 2\\nQ10: 3\\nQ11: 1\\nQ12: 2\\nQ13: 0\\nQ14: 0\\nQ15: 1\\nQ16: 3\\nQ17: 3\\nQ18: 0\\nQ19: 3\\nQ20: 0\\nFree Text Response 1: As a group, we decidet to go to a TAPS seminar that would help us deal with the feelings of loss an assist us with support.

While the resources and tools discussed at the seminar proved useful, I felt that the seminar fell short in addressing the internal conflicts that our family experienced. In order to better assist families coping with loss, I believe it would be beneficial to incorporate additional workshops or support groups specifically targeted at enhancing communication and understanding among family members. By doing so, it would provide a more comprehensive support system for families navigating these trying times. Ultimately, I am grateful for the opportunity to connect with other bereaved individuals and learn valuable lessons from the seminar; however, I truly believe that addressing family dynamics more effectively would have significantly enhanced the seminar\\'s overall impact for our family unit.\\n\\nExample 35:\\nQ1: 5\\nQ2: 5.0\\nQ3: 1\\nQ4: 0\\nQ5: 0\\nQ6: 0\\nQ7: 2\\nQ8: 3\\nQ9: 1\\nQ10: 1\\nQ11: 2\\nQ12: 0\\nQ13: 1\\nQ14: 3\\nQ15: 3\\nQ16: 3\\nQ17: 0\\nQ18: 2\\nQ19: 3\\nQ20: 0\\nFree Text Response 1: \"Over the weekend at the TAPS seminar, my favorite moment was during the group discussion session, where we were encouraged to share our grief experiences openly and honestly with each other.

I was told that it\\'s normal for family members to be at different stages in their grief journey, and that I shouldn\\'t compare my process to others. This insight has helped me to let go of the unrealistic expectations I had for my family\\'s grief experience, and to focus on finding ways to support and nurture my own emotional healing.\\n\\nThank you, TAPS, for providing a safe space and opportunities to grow, learn, and connect with others who share a similar journey.

The seminar provided a safe space for me to connect with other survivors who could relate to my story, and it was comforting to know we are not alone in our struggles.\\n\\nHowever, I noticed tension between my family members during the seminar, as we each cope with our loss in our own way. While some of us were more open to seeking support from others, some family members did not feel comfortable expressing their emotions. This led to a divide in our group and highlighted the need for a more tailored approach to support each person individually.\\n\\nOne area that could be improved is providing additional resources for family members who may not be open to seeking help or support from others. While the TAPS Seminar had many experts on grief and trauma, I think it would be beneficial to include workshops or sessions specifically for families with varied levels of engagement in the grieving process. This could help in bridging the gap within the family unit and ensure that everyone receives the support they need.\\n\\nOverall, I am grateful for the support and resources provided by TAPS during the seminar.

While the TAPS Seminar had many experts on grief and trauma, I think it would be beneficial to include workshops or sessions specifically for families with varied levels of engagement in the grieving process. This could help in bridging the gap within the family unit and ensure that everyone receives the support they need.\\n\\nOverall, I am grateful for the support and resources provided by TAPS during the seminar. I believe that with further consideration of individual family dynamics, TAPS can continue to help families heal and grow stronger through their grief journey.\"\\n\\nExample 15:\\nQ1: 4\\nQ2: nan\\nQ3: 2\\nQ4: 2\\nQ5: 0\\nQ6: 1\\nQ7: 3\\nQ8: 0\\nQ9: 1\\nQ10: 2\\nQ11: 3\\nQ12: 3\\nQ13: 2\\nQ14: 3\\nQ15: 3\\nQ16: 3\\nQ17: 3\\nQ18: 1\\nQ19: 0\\nQ20: 1\\nFree Text Response 1: \"I had a breakthrough moment at the TAPS seminar that truly stands out for me.

While the resources and tools discussed at the seminar proved useful, I felt that the seminar fell short in addressing the internal conflicts that our family experienced. In order to better assist families coping with loss, I believe it would be beneficial to incorporate additional workshops or support groups specifically targeted at enhancing communication and understanding among family members.

This insight has helped me to let go of the unrealistic expectations I had for my family\\'s grief experience, and to focus on finding ways to support and nurture my own emotional healing.\\n\\nThank you, TAPS, for providing a safe space and opportunities to grow, learn, and connect with others who share a similar journey. Your support and resources have been invaluable to me.\"\\nFree Text Response 2: \"As a participant of the TAPS Seminar, I found the experience to be incredibly valuable in helping me navigate my grief journey and understand the unique experiences my family members may be going through. The seminar provided a safe space for me to connect with other survivors who could relate to my story, and it was comforting to know we are not alone in our struggles.\\n\\nHowever, I noticed tension between my family members during the seminar, as we each cope with our loss in our own way. While some of us were more open to seeking support from others, some family members did not feel comfortable expressing their emotions. This led to a divide in our group and highlighted the need for a more tailored approach to support each person individually.\\n\\nOne area that could be improved is providing additional resources for family members who may not be open to seeking help or support from others. While the TAPS Seminar had many experts on grief and trauma, I think it would be beneficial to include workshops or sessions specifically for families with varied levels of engagement in the grieving process. This could help in bridging the gap within the family unit and ensure that everyone receives the support they need.\\n\\nOverall, I am grateful for the support and resources provided by TAPS during the seminar. I believe that with further consideration of individual family dynamics, TAPS can continue to help families heal and grow stronger through their grief journey.\"\\n\\nExample 29:\\nQ1: 6\\nQ2: nan\\nQ3: 0\\nQ4: 2\\nQ5: 1\\nQ6: 2\\nQ7: 0\\nQ8: 3\\nQ9: 3\\nQ10: 3\\nQ11: 3\\nQ12: 1\\nQ13: 3\\nQ14: 2\\nQ15: 0\\nQ16: 3\\nQ17: 1\\nQ18: 1\\nQ19: 0\\nQ20: 2\\nFree Text Response 1: \"In sessions promoting open communitcation, we learnt to acknowledge and undarstand our unique grief experienses, finding support with each other whilst celebrating our love ones\\' legacies during the remembrance ceremony, leading to uniting and sharid healing.\"\\nFree Text Response 2: \"I attended the TAPS Seminar, and overall, I found the experience to be both thought-provoking and supportive.
