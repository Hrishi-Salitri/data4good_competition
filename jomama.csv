It provided a space where I could connect with individuals who are facing similar circumstances, which made me feel less alone in my grief. However, it's clear that more tailored guidance and activities specifically for young grieving family members are needed, as we may not fully grasp or relate to the discussions presented. Despite the difficulty, I am grateful for the resources offered and the chance to find a sense of purpose in honoring our loved ones. TAPS has helped me navigate this tough journey, but understanding how to manage family responsibilities alone while grieving can be overwhelming at times.

Among my family members, there was a strong disconnect in our individual grief journeys. This made it quite difficult for us to find a common ground for support and understanding.

During the seminar, I focused primarily on learning more about my own emotions and tools to cope with my grief. It provided valuable resources and support for me, while for my family members, the seminar seemed not to resonate as much. This left us with a rather divided approach in coping with our loss, which led to some tension within the family.

Though the TAPS program and team were great in offering emotional and coping tools, I feel that it would have further strengthened the impact on our family if there were more opportunities specifically designed to address family dynamics and communication during the grieving process. This way, we can work towards unifying our grief journeys and become a better support system for each other, even in different stages of grieving."

The sessions conducted by the TAPS team were invaluable for learning how to cope with the loss of my loved one who served in the military.

One particularly memorable activity was the art therapy session. It was therapeutic to express our emotions with fellow survivors through paintings and drawings. It was like finding a safe haven amidst the emotions, as if we all shared a deeper connection that transcends our individual sorrows.

Yet, there were certain challenges. The materials and discussions offered needed to be tailored more towards younger participants – primarily the children and teens. We often felt disconnected and out of place. I believe future seminars could benefit from more age-relevant workshops, ensuring the support continues not only for adults but for younger survivors too, including myself.

Despite these challenges, my TAPS Seminar experience has been deeply impactful, fostering connections and offering invaluable guidance at this devastating juncture of my life. I will forever be grateful for this experience, and hope it continues to support and uplift the grieving community, children, teenagers and beyond."

I went in with high expectations about finding support and guidance while navigating the journey of losing my loved one in the military community. As the seminar progressed, I noticed that the primary focus was on sharing experiences and exploring coping mechanisms. While it was crucial to explore these methods, my biggest challenge was the lack of emphasis on improving family dynamics and open communication.

My family experienced some tension and communication barriers, and many of the resources offered at the seminar did not specifically address our needs as a unit. While attending the TAPS seminar, I discovered the importance of self-care and self-expression, and it became my focus during the seminar.

Looking ahead, I would appreciate more workshops dedicated to the complexities of family dynamics during grieving. A support system for families navigating through a difficult time together could have made a significant difference in my family's experience.
